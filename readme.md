# OCPI-Beckn Bridge: Technical Concept Note

## Executive Summary

The OCPI-Beckn Bridge is a comprehensive protocol translation system that enables seamless integration between Beckn's open commerce protocol and OCPI's charging infrastructure standard. This bridge facilitates standardized EV charging service discovery, booking, and billing across heterogeneous charging networks, creating a unified customer experience while maintaining protocol-specific technical requirements.

## Problem Statement and Solution

### The Challenge

Electric vehicle charging infrastructure operates in fragmented ecosystems where charging point operators use OCPI for technical operations while consumer applications require standardized commerce protocols like Beckn. This creates barriers for:

- Unified service discovery across multiple charging networks
- Standardized booking and payment workflows
- Consistent billing and settlement processes
- Seamless customer experience across different operators

### Our Solution

The OCPI-Beckn Bridge acts as a bidirectional protocol translator that maps Beckn's commerce-oriented messages to OCPI's infrastructure-oriented operations. This enables Beckn-based consumer applications to interact with OCPI-compliant charging infrastructure without requiring either side to modify their existing implementations.

## Protocol Mapping Architecture

### Beckn to OCPI Domain Mapping

**Beckn Commerce Model → OCPI Infrastructure Model**

Beckn operates on a commerce abstraction where users discover, select, and purchase services. OCPI operates on infrastructure abstraction managing locations, sessions, and billing records. Our bridge translates between these paradigms:

- Beckn "items" map to OCPI "connectors" at specific locations
- Beckn "orders" map to OCPI "charging sessions"
- Beckn "fulfillments" map to OCPI "location-based service delivery"
- Beckn "billing" maps to OCPI "charge detail records"

### Core Operation Mappings

#### 1. Search Operation Mapping

**Beckn Search Request → OCPI Locations Query**

Beckn search requests contain geographical intent and service categories. The bridge extracts location criteria and transforms them into OCPI location queries:

- GPS coordinates from Beckn intent become latitude/longitude parameters for OCPI
- Beckn category filters map to OCPI connector type filters
- Beckn time preferences map to OCPI availability queries
- Beckn fulfillment requirements map to OCPI facility filters

**OCPI Locations Response → Beckn Catalog Response**

OCPI returns structured location data with EVSEs and connectors. The bridge transforms this into Beckn's catalog format:

- Each OCPI connector becomes a Beckn catalog item
- OCPI location details become Beckn location metadata
- OCPI tariff information becomes Beckn pricing data
- OCPI availability status becomes Beckn item availability

#### 2. Selection Operation Mapping

**Beckn Select Request → OCPI Session Initiation**

When users select charging options, Beckn sends selection requests with chosen items. The bridge extracts OCPI session parameters:

- Beckn item IDs are decomposed to extract location_id, evse_uid, and connector_id
- Beckn user authorization tokens map to OCPI session tokens
- Beckn fulfillment preferences map to OCPI session parameters

**OCPI Session Response → Beckn Selection Confirmation**

OCPI session initiation returns session identifiers and authorization details:

- OCPI session IDs become Beckn order IDs
- OCPI authorization references become Beckn order authorization details
- OCPI session status maps to Beckn order state

#### 3. Confirmation Operation Mapping

**Beckn Confirm Request → OCPI Session Confirmation**

Beckn confirmation requests trigger actual service initiation. The bridge converts these to OCPI session confirmations:

- Beckn order IDs map directly to OCPI session IDs
- Beckn confirmation triggers OCPI session activation
- Beckn payment authorization maps to OCPI billing authorization

#### 4. Status Operation Mapping

**Beckn Status Request → OCPI Session Status Query**

Real-time status monitoring requires continuous translation:

- Beckn order status requests map to OCPI session status queries
- OCPI session telemetry data maps to Beckn order progress updates
- OCPI energy consumption data maps to Beckn service consumption metrics

#### 5. Update Operation Mapping

**Beckn Update Request → OCPI Session Update**

Session modifications and termination require careful state management:

- Beckn order updates map to OCPI session state changes
- Beckn cancellation requests map to OCPI session termination
- Beckn payment updates map to OCPI billing modifications

#### 6. Billing Operation Mapping

**OCPI CDR Generation → Beckn Billing Records**

Post-session billing requires comprehensive data transformation:

- OCPI charge detail records map to Beckn billing summaries
- OCPI energy consumption data maps to Beckn service usage metrics
- OCPI cost calculations map to Beckn payment obligations
- OCPI tariff applications map to Beckn pricing breakdowns

## Data Transformation Logic

### Location Data Transformation

The bridge implements sophisticated location data mapping between OCPI's technical infrastructure model and Beckn's service discovery model:

**OCPI Location Structure**: Country code, party ID, location ID, EVSEs array, connectors array, facilities, operator information, coordinates

**Beckn Catalog Structure**: Items array, locations array, fulfillments array, categories, pricing information

**Transformation Process**:
- Each OCPI location generates multiple Beckn items (one per connector)
- OCPI facility information maps to Beckn fulfillment capabilities
- OCPI operator details map to Beckn provider information
- OCPI coordinates map to Beckn GPS location data

### Session Data Transformation

Session management requires maintaining state consistency across both protocols:

**OCPI Session Lifecycle**: PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED → ARCHIVED
**Beckn Order Lifecycle**: ACTIVE → FULFILLED → COMPLETED → CANCELLED

**State Mapping Logic**:
- OCPI PENDING maps to Beckn ACTIVE (reservation made)
- OCPI ACTIVE maps to Beckn FULFILLED (service in progress)
- OCPI COMPLETED maps to Beckn COMPLETED (service finished)
- Error states map to appropriate Beckn cancellation states

### Pricing Data Transformation

Financial data requires careful currency and taxation handling:

**OCPI Tariff Structure**: Price components, VAT rates, currency, billing dimensions
**Beckn Price Structure**: Base price, tax information, currency, total amount

**Transformation Rules**:
- OCPI energy-based pricing maps to Beckn per-unit pricing
- OCPI time-based pricing maps to Beckn duration-based pricing
- OCPI VAT calculations map to Beckn tax breakdowns
- OCPI billing periods map to Beckn usage summaries

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Protocol Abstraction Layer

The bridge implements a three-layer architecture:

**Layer 1: Protocol Adapters** - Handle native protocol message parsing and generation
**Layer 2: Data Transformation Engine** - Manages bidirectional data mapping
**Layer 3: Business Logic Coordinator** - Orchestrates multi-step workflows

### Error Handling and Validation

Robust error handling ensures system reliability:

- Protocol validation ensures message compliance
- Data validation prevents transformation errors
- State validation maintains session consistency
- Timeout handling manages network reliability

### Mock Implementation Benefits

The mock implementation provides several advantages:

**Development Benefits**: Enables development without infrastructure dependencies
**Testing Benefits**: Provides consistent, repeatable test scenarios
**Documentation Benefits**: Serves as executable specification of protocol mappings
**Integration Benefits**: Allows testing of edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Opportunities

**Payment Systems**: Direct integration with payment gateways for seamless transactions
**Route Planning**: Integration with mapping services for journey optimization
**Grid Management**: Connection to smart grid systems for load balancing
**Fleet Management**: Support for commercial fleet charging coordination

## Conclusion

The OCPI-Beckn Bridge represents a significant technical achievement in protocol interoperability, enabling seamless integration between commerce and infrastructure protocols in the EV charging domain. By providing comprehensive data transformation, robust error handling, and scalable architecture, the bridge creates a foundation for truly interoperable EV charging ecosystems. The mock implementation demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach while providing a practical development and testing environment for further enhancement and deployment.
